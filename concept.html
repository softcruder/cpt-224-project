      <h2>Conceptualization of the web.</h2>
      <p>
        The web is a global system of interconnected documents and other
        resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs. It is a vast network of
        information that can be accessed via the internet. The web is often
        considered to be a part of the internet, but it is actually a collection
        of documents and other resources that are accessible through the
        internet.
      </p>
      <p>The web has five main components:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Hypertext</strong>: The web is made up of interconnected
          documents, known as hypertext. Hypertext allows users to easily
          navigate between different documents and resources by clicking on
          links, also known as hyperlinks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hypermedia</strong>: The web is not just text, but also
          includes other types of media such as images, videos, and audio files.
          Hypermedia allows users to interact with and experience multimedia
          content on the web.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hyperlinks</strong>: As mentioned earlier, hyperlinks are the
          connections between different documents and resources on the web. They
          allow users to easily navigate between different pages and explore the
          vast amount of information available on the web.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>URLs</strong>: URLs, or uniform resource locators, are the
          addresses of individual documents and resources on the web. They allow
          users to easily access specific pages or files on the web by entering
          the URL into their web browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Web browsers</strong>: A web browser is a software application
          that allows users to access, view, and interact with the content on
          the web. Popular examples of web browsers include Google Chrome,
          Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
